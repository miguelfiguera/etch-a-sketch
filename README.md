# etch-a-sketch


a web sketching app, very simple, very nice. Very hard to get by...


Notes:

Getting the code readable was hard this time...

I used almost the same code for the colorGrabber Shading and Lighten because they share
a lot of similarity, you can see it (i left it that way for two reasons= 1- I did not know how to do it 2- it is a lesson learned)
I may change it on the future.

getting the on click colored div was the bug I have to debug later... so... was hard to do.

I learned a lot and have a wonderfull time reading other peoples code.
