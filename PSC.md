Pseudo code for this project:

1) the grid:
Stablish the full size of the grid.
Create a div that can be modified by hovering/clicking
create X number of divs with the same characteristics where X= number of columns && number of rows.
append all that to the same grid.

2) the panel:
create a panel that lets you:
a - select color (and display the color).
b - clear grid
c - select size of the grid with a prompt or a slider (and shows the select size)
d - select rainbow mode

3) write the functions for:
clearGrid()
colorChange()
rainbowMode()
createGrid()
changeSize()

4) this web app will have three main parts on its body:
a - header
b - body: with the grid and a panel
c - footer with a link to my github account. (lets put my name on it).

I will use the correct tool for every part. HTML to give form, CSS for the style and JS to the
interactions with the page.
